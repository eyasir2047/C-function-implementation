Problem Statement: Library Management System

Imagine you are building a Library Management System using Java and MySQL. In this system, you need to represent books, users, and library transactions. Implement the following classes/interfaces:

LibraryItem (Abstract Class):

Define an abstract class LibraryItem with fields like id, title, author, and publicationYear. Include constructors and getter methods.
Book (Class):

Create a class Book that extends LibraryItem. It should include an additional field isbn. Implement appropriate constructors and getter methods.
LibraryUser (Interface):

Define an interface LibraryUser with methods like borrowItem(LibraryItem item), returnItem(LibraryItem item), and viewCheckedOutItems(). Implement these methods as per the interface.
Student (Class):

Create a class Student that implements the LibraryUser interface. Include fields like studentId, name, and a collection (e.g., ArrayList) to track borrowed items. Implement the methods from the interface.
LibraryTransaction (Class):

Create a class LibraryTransaction with fields like transactionId, user, libraryItem, and transactionDate. Include constructors and getter methods.
LibraryDatabase (Class):

Implement a class LibraryDatabase that handles database interactions.
Include methods like addBook(Book book), removeBook(int bookId), getUserById(int userId), getUserByName(String userName), getBookById(int bookId), and getTransactionById(int transactionId).
Use JDBC to connect to the MySQL database and perform CRUD operations on books, users, and transactions.
LibraryApp (Main Class):

Create a LibraryApp class with the main method to test your library system.
Perform the following tasks:
Create a few instances of Book and Student.
Add books to the library database.
Allow students to borrow and return books.
Display the list of books, users, and transactions.
Remember to establish a connection to the MySQL database within the LibraryDatabase class and use it for storing and retrieving data.
